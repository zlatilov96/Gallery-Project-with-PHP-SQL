**Gallery Project with PHP/SQL functionality**

This is a gallery project created for one of my university courses concentrating on PHP/SQL.

The idea behind this project is to make users able to upload photos they have taken and share them with the community on this website.

Admin Panel is available for the admin of this gallery website. The admin can view, publish, edit / update and delete photos users have published from the admin panel.
As an addition to this, users can be also deleted from the Admin Panel of the website.

**Installation:**

- Install XAMPP

- Copy all the project files into the "htdocs" directory of your XAMPP into a folder of your choice.

- Go to the folder you just saved the project to and unzip "phpmailer.zip" file. I was not able to upload the folder just like the other two folders because it contains more than 100 files in it. PHPMailer is used to make the connection of the contact form with Gmail.

- Open PHPMyAdmin with your browser and import the "localdb.sql" file.

- Access the project through this link (http://localhost/name-of-folder-you-saved-the-project/index.php)

- Check if everything is working properly.

- The Admin Panel can be accessed through this link (http://localhost/name-of-folder-you-saved-the-project/admin_area/index.php)

- Use the following credentials to access the Admin Panel and use the functionallity there:
  - Username: admin
  - Passowrd: 1234
